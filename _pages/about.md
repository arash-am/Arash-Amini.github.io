Hey there! I'm Arash Amini, [postdoctoral associate](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Arash-Amini/) at UT Austin's [Oden Institute](https://oden.utexas.edu/). My Ph.D. was in controlling networks; now I study how information controls us. My research focus on understanding the impact of information distortion on our actions and opinions. It's complex, computational, and crucial!
